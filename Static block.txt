Method Area->1.In this all the required file which are use full for the class runing the application.
             2.In this all the satic member is loading inside this type of the memory area.
Heap Area-> 1.In this all the non static member is place inside this.

Static Memeber flow using the JVM Architecture
=====================================
-> It contains the four types of the static members
A) Static main method
B)Static Block
C)Static Method
D)Static Variable


A) Main method
   =========

B) Static Block
    =========
1. It has no identity but it contains the basic information about the program.
2.It communicate with the main method
3.it is optional to declare the static block
4.It is always exceuted before the main method
5.we can not invoke the static block 
6.JVM invoked the static block at the time of class loading

B)
